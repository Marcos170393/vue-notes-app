## 🤩 Main Features 

- ✍️ **Full Text Editor:** Create notes with an powerful text editor.
- ☁️ **Cloud Sync:** Keep your notes safe and accessible from anywhere.
- 🚀 **More Features Coming Soon!** I'm working on new exciting features!

## 🤔 Why did I create this project? 

The main goal was to create my own tool to store notes and be able to access them from any device. 
Once the project is complete in a full and stable version, I would like other people to participate to improve it and turn it
into an Open-Source project, useful, powerful, attractive and above all, available and free for everyone.

So if you want to participate in any way, please contact me and let's make something great 🚀🚀.
